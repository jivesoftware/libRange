libRange
========

libRange emulates the W3C DOM Range API on IE 8 and earlier.  It's based on TinyMCE's code for the same, but depends only on jQuery (lightly) and an AMD implementation.

libRange also has a couple of utility methods that are useful when working with text, and some selection and range logging methods.

libRange is provided under the terms of the LGPL, version 2.1.
